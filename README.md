This sample bot is used in the [**FacetedSearch demo**](https://docs.botfuel.io/platform/demos/faceted-search).

## Create an app

* Create a new app on Botfuel Trainer (https://app.botfuel.io). See the [Getting Started tutorial](https://tutorials.botfuel.io/#/codelab/getting-started?step=1) for how to create a new app.

* Add an intent with lable `article` with the following training phrases for examples:

  * I want to buy a pair of jeans
  * I want to buy a shirt
  * I want to buy some polos

* Add an intent with lable `greetings` with the following training phrases for examples:
  * Hi
  * Hello

You can get examples of intents here : https://github.com/Botfuel/botfuel-sample-facetedsearch/blob/master/intents.xlsx

## How to run the bot

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Botfuel/botfuel-sample-facetedsearch.git
```

Install dependencies

```
cd botfuel-sample-facetedsearch
yarn install
```

Start the bot:

```bash
BOTFUEL_APP_TOKEN=<...> BOTFUEL_APP_ID=<...> BOTFUEL_APP_KEY=<...> yarn start shell-config.js
```

If you set your app credentials right, you should see:

```bash
2018-04-05T20:31:26.529Z - info: [Environment] BOTFUEL_APP_TOKEN=<YOUR_BOT_APP_TOKEN>
2018-04-05T20:31:26.531Z - info: [Environment] BOTFUEL_APP_ID=<YOUR_BOT_ID>
2018-04-05T20:31:26.532Z - info: [Environment] BOTFUEL_APP_KEY=<YOUR_BOT_APP_KEY>
2018-04-05T20:31:26.588Z - debug: [ShellAdapter] run
```

Try typing `Hello` and `I want to buy a polo`
